                <h2>Aspirations</h2>
                <p>My dream is to become an expert in artificial intelligence (AI) which comes from my love for its power to change how businesses work and how we use tech. The AI field needs a strong set of skills, including tech know-how in machine learning, data checking, and coding, along with soft skills like problem-solving, sharp thinking, and good time planning.</p>

                <p>Going to an "Hour of Exam Bootcamp" and a "3-hour Thesis Writing Camp" made me see how important careful plans and clear thinking are for making AI programs. Classes like "SPSS Basics" gave me a starting point in using stats software, key for data-heavy AI work. Readings on Google Scholar, like "Efficient Algorithms for Public-Private Key Systems" (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, 1978), show the still-big need for solid stats knowledge in AI. Also, LinkedIn has groups like "AI Innovators" where experts talk about new changes and tough spots in AI, giving clues on what skills are needed in the field.</p>
